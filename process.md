# Process

Experience has shown us that inclusive design must be thought about from the earliest stages of a projectâ€™s development. The later in the process it is addressed, the fewer the options and the greater the risk that opportunities will be lost and retrofits needed.

Responsibility for access and inclusion is shared by all staff and contractors, but each project team includes a Visitor Experience Manager who acts as advocate for visitors and can provide specialist knowledge throughout the process.

At Approvals Stage \(before tender submission\) detailed designs are assessed against the key criteria of the Design Brief, Inclusive Design Guidelines as well as Display Case Guidelines and Build Materials Guidelines.

When each exhibition has been delivered and opened to the public, we run a group consultation to invite feedback on the entire visitor journey as well as responses to any design elements that were tested with users as part of the design development process.
