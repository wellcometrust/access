# Introduction

Wellcome has a responsibility to be at the forefront of inclusive exhibition design and programming. We want to create a standard of visitor experience that is consistently and seamlessly inclusive and we want to do this in a way that is positive and creative.

Supporting this aim is a key aspect of our brief to designers. We want to work with designers who understand, and can demonstrate, that inclusive design is an opportunity for creativity and innovation. We define inclusive design as something that:

* Creates a welcoming and positive experience for all
* Is consistent, but not uniform
* Removes physical and intellectual barriers to our content and spaces
* Maximises user independence
* Is intuitive to use
* Offers choice and flexibility
* Is based on consultation and experience, rather than assumptions about needs
* Draws on the specialism of every member of the project team

### Using the guidelines

This document contains a mix of set criteria that describe our minimum standards and a set of prompts \(“marked in green”\) \(IMAGE example\) meant to serve as starting points to think about accessibility in new ways. These guidelines are an invitation to innovate with us, throughout the exhibition making process, to create better experiences for all visitors.
