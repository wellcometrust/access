# Prototyping and user testing

We encourage designers to build-in user consultation to their design process. If we feel that user consultation is appropriate and useful during design development, we can support design teams by promoting and facilitating user test sessions.

We regularly invite people with a wide range of perspectives \(including mobility disabilities, sight loss, hearing loss, dyslexia and dyspraxia\) to comment on the way that we make exhibitions â€“ to respond to prototypes and to comment on our exhibitions when they are up and running.
